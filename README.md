# UFO
# Overview
Dana’s webpage and tables are working as intended, but we like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
# Results
We have created a webpage for Dana that is very user friendly. There are multiple search criteria. It's user choice on what basis and what data they would want to narrow
down the search. It can filter on basis of date, city, state, country and shape. This is a very appealing option and that's what makes the webpage user friendly. Below 
is the image as how the webpage looks

If we filter the webpage according to state we would get the following result

Another filter we can filter is by date and the result will be as follows

There are also other filters that we can use such as search by country, shape and city.
# Summary
One drawback that I see on this webpage is that the filters and the table should go side by side and another that we do not need the country 
filter in it as this data only has the data for US so country filter is unnecessary.
One suggestion for the filter can be a drop down menu and with check mark option to filter.
Another suggestion is to gather data from all over the world for UFO sightings as this can be appealing to search and then add by country filter.
